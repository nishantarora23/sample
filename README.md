## Project Approach and Technology

### Project Approach
- The goal of this project is to create an online career services network platform called "CareerConnect" that links companies and job seekers. Students will be able to submit and update their portfolios on the site, while companies can post employment openings. The objective is to promote personalised job matching and expedite the job search process.
We will follow an Agile development approach to allow for flexibility and adaptability. The project will be divided into iterations/sprints, with regular reviews through sprint demos and opportunities to incorporate feedback and changes.
- Sprint-1 is the project planning phase which will involve defining project objectives, scope, and deliverables. We will identify the primary users (students, employers) and their key functionalities. A product backlog will be created, prioritizing features and user stories for each iteration.
- The project team will consist of a project manager, product owner, scrum master, QA, business analyst and architect with a broad set of strengths spread across backend and frontend development, testing and expertise on various technologies. The team will collaborate closely with stakeholders, including students, employers, and career services staff.
- We will utilize GitHub for version control, issue tracking, and project management. Communication and collaboration will be facilitated through Zoom, allowing real-time communication and file sharing.
- The development process will involve gathering and analyzing requirements, designing user interfaces, implementing functionality, and testing. Each iteration will focus on specific features and deliverables, ensuring incremental progress.
- Quality will be ensured through comprehensive testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Code reviews and quality checks will be performed to maintain high standards.
- Risks will be identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the project. Regular risk assessments will be conducted, and contingency plans will be in place to address potential issues.
- A project timeline will be created, outlining major milestones and deliverables for each iteration. There will be 4 sprints and each sprint will typically last between 1.5 to 2.5 weeks, with regular sprint reviews and retrospectives.
- Key project documentation, including requirements documents, design documents, and user guides, will be created and maintained on GitHub Wiki pages.
- End-user training materials and documentation will be created to assist students, employers, and administrators in using the platform effectively. Ongoing support channels will be established to address user inquiries and issues.
