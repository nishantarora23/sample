## Project Description
### Overview
CareerConnect is a comprehensive web-based career services platform which is aimed to provide user-friendly and centralized tools to both employers and job seekers in the job search process.

### Scope
1. User Profiles : CareerConnect allows the students or other job-seekers to create their job profile that showcase their qualifications, skills, work experience and other interests, enhance it according to the market trends and update their resumes. These profiles serve as a portfolio that enable users to hightlight their expertise to potential employers.

2. Employer Profiles : Employers can leverage this platform to create and post the job opportunities and shortlist the candidates who are the most suitable for their requirements.

3. Ease job-search and application : This platform aims to streamline the job hunting process by providing user-friendly interface for candidates to quickly search, filter and apply for the positions they are most interested in. 

4. Application tracking : CareerConnect aims to simply the application tracking process. Once a candidate applies for the job, the hiring manager gets notified and is able to view the profile of the job-applicant. The system also notifies the selected candidates who are further called for an interview.

### Resources required
- Development team with expertise in web application development, user experience design, and database management.
- Tools and technologies to create the platform.
- Servers and infrastructure to host the platform.

## Project Approach and Technology

### Project Approach
- The goal of this project is to create an online career services network platform called "CareerConnect" that links companies and job seekers. Students will be able to submit and update their portfolios on the site, while companies can post employment openings. The objective is to promote personalised job matching and expedite the job search process.
We will follow an Agile development approach to allow for flexibility and adaptability. The project will be divided into iterations/sprints, with regular reviews through sprint demos and opportunities to incorporate feedback and changes.
- Sprint-1 is the project planning phase which will involve defining project objectives, scope, and deliverables. We will identify the primary users (students, employers) and their key functionalities. A product backlog will be created, prioritizing features and user stories for each iteration.
- The project team will consist of a project manager, product owner, scrum master, QA, business analyst and architect with a broad set of strengths spread across backend and frontend development, testing and expertise on various technologies. The team will collaborate closely with stakeholders, including students, employers, and career services staff.
- We will utilize GitHub for version control, issue tracking, and project management. Communication and collaboration will be facilitated through Zoom, allowing real-time communication and file sharing.
- The development process will involve gathering and analyzing requirements, designing user interfaces, implementing functionality, and testing. Each iteration will focus on specific features and deliverables, ensuring incremental progress.
- Quality will be ensured through comprehensive testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Code reviews and quality checks will be performed to maintain high standards.
- Risks will be identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the project. Regular risk assessments will be conducted, and contingency plans will be in place to address potential issues.
- A project timeline will be created, outlining major milestones and deliverables for each iteration. There will be 4 sprints and each sprint will typically last between 1.5 to 2.5 weeks, with regular sprint reviews and retrospectives.
- Key project documentation, including requirements documents, design documents, and user guides, will be created and maintained on GitHub Wiki pages.
- End-user training materials and documentation will be created to assist students, employers, and administrators in using the platform effectively. Ongoing support channels will be established to address user inquiries and issues.


### Technology
CareerConnect will leverage a combination of modern technologies to ensure efficient development, seamless integration, and effective project management. The following technologies have been chosen based on their compatibility, industry standards, and proven track record:

    <i> Fig. 1 Technology Stack and Architecture Diagram</i>
    <br/>
  </p>

- **Front-End Development: React**
<br>The user interface of the application will be developed using the React JavaScript library. React provides a component-based architecture that enables modular and reusable code, resulting in a more efficient development process. Its virtual DOM rendering and state management capabilities enhance the performance and responsiveness of the application, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Back-End Development: Java Servlets**
<br>The back-end of the application will be implemented using Java Servlets. Servlets provide a robust and scalable framework for handling HTTP requests and building RESTful APIs. With its extensive Java ecosystem and support for enterprise-grade development, Servlets allow for seamless integration with various libraries, frameworks, and databases.

- **Database Management System: MySQL**
<br>For data storage and management, the project will utilize the MySQL relational database management system. MySQL is widely recognized for its performance, scalability, and reliability. Its support for SQL queries and ACID-compliant transactions ensures efficient data manipulation and retrieval, making it suitable for handling the project's data storage requirements.

- **Continuous Integration and Deployment: Jenkins with Gradle**
<br>To facilitate continuous integration and deployment, we will employ Jenkins, an open-source automation server. Jenkins, integrated with Gradle, will automate the building, testing, and deployment processes. This will ensure the project's codebase remains stable and reliable, enabling rapid iterations and reducing the risk of deployment errors.

- **Source Control and Project Management: GitHub**
<br>GitHub will serve as the primary source control management (SCM) tool for the project, providing version control and collaboration features. It will also act as a ticketing tool, allowing for issue tracking, task assignment, and progress monitoring. The project's repository on GitHub will provide transparency and facilitate effective project management, ensuring seamless collaboration among team members.
